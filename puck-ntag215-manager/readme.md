## How to use amiibeau

First, you'll need to install the custom firmware for the puck.js that adds NTAG215 emulation.

Head over to the [ntag215-puck.js project page](https://dantheman827.github.io/ntag215-puck.js/) to do this... and maybe buy the original developer, [dantheman827](https://dantheman827.github.io/ntag215), a coffee while you're there.

Once you have the custom firmware installed, you'll be able to come back here and connect to the tag.
